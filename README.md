Developed a model that authenticates the end users based on their electroencephalogram (EEG) signals

A Brain Computer Interface is a direct neural interface or a brainâ€“machine interface. It provides a communication path between human brain and the computer system. It aims to convey people's intentions to the outside world directly from their thoughts.

The current model uses brain signals for the authentication of  users. The Electro- Encephalogram (EEG) signals are recorded from the neuroheadset when a user is shown a key image (signature image) .These signals are further processed and are interpreted to obtain the thought pattern of the user to match them to the stored password in the system. Even if other person is presented with the same key image it fails to authenticate as the cortical folds of the brain are unique to each human being just like a fingerprint or DNA .

The need for robust security system is increasing day by day. The existing security systems such as passwords, biometric systems which include fingerprint  technology, retinal scan are becoming vulnerable to attacks. This is because, passwords can be guessed by brute force approach, fingerprints can be obtained when an user touches any physical object. . However, EEG waves emerging from brain can neither be guessed nor copied. The fact that thought of a person is unique can be used as a password to open a lock like a bank vault or other systems where high level of encryption is necessary.
